## Medical insurance bills 

In this project I will be working with a medical cost dataset. The data set contains information on indiviudal medical insurance bills, each bill has some demographics and perosnal charactersitics of the person who recieved it. For regression we are interested in how these characteristics are realted to total medical costs. The model will allow us to predict the medical costs, allowing hospitals to know their future revenue or atleast estimate it.
